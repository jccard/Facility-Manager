/*
This class is the super class for the individual Facility Departments.
eg: Product, Employee, and Project

I want to have the common properties here, as well as any common functions.
I mean, that's the point of inherited classes.
The only function I can think of right now is the sub-department display on
 the statsPanel, but that is a good place to start. It will simplify the
 stats_panel.dart file.
